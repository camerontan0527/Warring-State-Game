1. What are the best features of this code?
   (a) The code in this task passed all the tests.
   (b) The code is clear in thought. It is written line by line followed by the game rules.
   (c) He creates some useful functions for the task

2. Is the code well-documented?
   I believe the code is well-documented since it passed all the tests and the author wrote comments to make it easeier for viewer to understand.

3. Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
   The decomposition is well-designed (methods)

4. Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
   The method and variable names are properly named. For example, it clearly showed the methods is to extracting out the cards on the same row and column. 

Suggestions:
   Even though it is convenient to create methods and use them elsewhere, but some methods are only used once in the program.
   In this way, I think he doesn't need to create a method, instead he can just write the code in the program.
