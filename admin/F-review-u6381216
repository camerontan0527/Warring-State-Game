Review Comments:
What are the best features of this code?
1. Use of a helper function (isCardAlreadyExistInOtherPLayer)
2. Well implemented and logically thought through to insure the tests for task 7 pass.
3. All cases considered so that the tests for task 7 can pass.

Is the code well-documented?
The comments are well written so any individual can understand what the purpose of specific lines in the code are doing (e.g. lines 721-736 which
contains code for adding the supporters collected along a row/column for each move to an array).

Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
There are some sections within task 7 which can be moved to a separate method creating a helper function. This would potentially not affect the functionality of this
task and will allow easy readability. For example, helper function can be created for the following sections of the code:
    - adding the supporters collected along each row/column for each move to an array
    - determining the initial position to zhang
    -sorting the supporters list into ascending order

Does it follow Java code conventions and is the style consistent throughout?
Variables could be named according to java code conventions (e.g. possible_kingdom can be changed to possibleKingdom).

Suggestions:
If a helper function is used to sort the supporters into ascending order four blocks of code would possibly not be needed to obtain an output.
This could be done through passing a supporters for any player string to this helper function to be sorted.
