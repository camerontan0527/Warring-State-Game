Review Comments:

1. What are the best features of this code?
   (a) The code in this task passed all the tests.
   (b) Use try and catch to catch the exception.
   (c) Various data types have been used(e.g. HashMap, ArrayList).

2. Is the code well-documented?
   Comments are well written, which is helpful to others to understand which part of code is doing what kind of work.
   The author also implemented 2 helper functions to make this task simpler to understand.

3. Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
   Structure is well formed. ArrayList and HashMap have been used properly.

4. Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
   The code follows Java code convention well. Variables and functions have been correctly named.

Suggestions:
   Some of the variables are created but never been used, which means this variable are not helpful for this task
   (e.g. checkTwoOrMorePLayersHaveSameCard). I kindly suggest that these variables can be deleted.
