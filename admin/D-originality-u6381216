I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage D of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <...> came from a discussion with <...>

* The code in class sortString uses an idea of splitting the string into and array with elements of two characters in the string. (website is underneath the function).
